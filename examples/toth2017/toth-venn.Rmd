# Cognitive specialization for learning faces is associated with shifts in the brain transcriptome of a social wasp

This venn diagram is from [this paper](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/12/2149)

```{r GOvenn-alt}

GOvenn$species <- factor(GOvenn$species, levels = c("P.fusatus", "P.metricus",  "both"))

levels(GOvenn$GO) <- c("biological processes", " molecular functions")

GOvenn %>%
  spread(species, count) %>%
  select(GO, pattern,P.fusatus, both, P.metricus)

In
this example, the circles do not represent a meaningful quantity. A
stacked bar plot can use color, space, and text to highlight patterns in
the data, which in this case appears to be a greater overlap than
expected. I wanted to make the bar plot mirror the Venn diagram as
closely as possible, but I changed the order of the factors so that
“both” category was plotted first. This was necessary for adding text to
the bar chart because the values for *P. metricus* and both were
overlapping when I kept the “both” category in the middle.
