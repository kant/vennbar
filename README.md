This is a place where I have started store examples of published Venn diagrams and with my suggested alternative bar plots.

Example 1 from [Early life stress alters transcriptomic patterning across reward circuitry in male and female mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/624353v1) by Catherine Jensen Pe√±a _et al._ [My preprint review (in progress) and data viz alternatives can be read here.](./examples/pena2019/fig2venn.md)

Example 2 is from [Cognitive specialization for learning faces is associated with shifts in the brain transcriptome of a social wasp](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/12/2149). The code for my bar plot alternative [is here.](./examples/toth2017/GOvenn.md)
